//! Driving a two-field spectrum run and exporting its rows.
//!
//! The run has three stages. A background survey locates the end of inflation
//! and fixes the pivot `k_pivot = a_* H_*`. Each requested wavenumber is then
//! carried forward to its own `x_init = k/(aH)` crossing, initialized in the
//! Bunch-Davies vacuum there, and evolved together with the background. The
//! spectra are projected at one requested output time.
//!
//! The accepted background survey states form one cubic-Hermite trajectory in
//! elapsed e-folds. Every wavenumber then evolves only its mode matrix against
//! that immutable trajectory. The former coupled background-plus-mode path is
//! retained in tests as a numerical reference.
